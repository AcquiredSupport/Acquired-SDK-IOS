# Acquired IOS Library
Want to add checkout to your IOS app? No matter if your shopper wants to pay with a card (optionally with 3D Secure & One-click), wallet or a local payment method â€“ all can be integrated in the same way, using the Acquired SDK. The Acquired SDK encrypts sensitive card data and sends it directly to Acquired in order to keep your PCI scope limited.

## Requirements

- IOS 9.0+
- Xcode 7.1.1+

## HPP Library Installation


### Manual

If you prefer not to use a dependency manager, you can integrate the Acquired iOS Library into your project manually.

- Download the the latest release from GitHub:

    https://github.com/AcquiredSupport/Acquired-SDK-IOS/releases

- Drag and drop the folder 'Acquired_SDK_IOS' into Xcode to use the HPP part of the library.

## Using the HPP Library

### Instantiate

To instantiate an instance of the HPP manager do the following:

```
let hppManager = HppManager()
```


### Integrate With Your Server

The HPP Manager requires some Hpp settings which you can get it on acquired dashboard(server side).

1) **Company Id**: utilizing one of the Acquired HPP server SDKs; Company Id is necessary to create an instance of HppSetting which is required for HPPManager.

2) **Company MID Id**: Using this value that SDK will choose template that already set on server side.

3) **Company Hash**: This parameter is used to encode the requests of HPP, a new hash will be generated , server side will check the validdity of the hash and decodes the response.

```
let hppSetting = HppSetting(companyId:142,  companyMidId:1103,  companyHash:""your hash string")
```

### Present Payment Form

Insert the code  to present a payment form as follows:

```
hppManager.loadHppView(viewController: self, hppSetting: hppSetting)
```

Executing this code, HPP Manager will process the given parameters(HppSetting), get the request from the server, send the encoded request to HPP and present the form received back.

###  HPP Response 

On the server-side you can set your own return url or call back url, hpp will handle response automatically that you don't have to do any response handling on your app. You can also set another return url or call back url when calling HPPManager in your app:

```
hppSetting.error_url = "xxx"
hppSetting.return_url = "xxx"
hppSetting.merchant_customer_id = "xxx"
```

## FAQ

### Set HPP Properties
HppSetting is used to provide all pamarters that server requires:card detail, shipping address, billing adress...etc 
You can also set whatever HPP properties you need to in the component, for example;

```
hppSetting.is_debug = true
hppSetting.transaction_type = "AUTH_ONLY"
hppSetting.currency_code_iso3 = "GBP"
hppSetting.amount = 100.1
hppSetting.billing_email = "xxx"
hppSetting.customer_company = "xxx"
...
```

These will be sent to the *Request Producer URL*, your server-side code must be setup to take in these values and pass them to the HPP server-side SDK for them to be included in the request.  

### Testing     

Acquired maintain separate endpoints for live and test transactions. Use the code below:

```
hppSetting.is_debug = true
```
